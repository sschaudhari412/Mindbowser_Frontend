#  Frontend - Blogging Platform

This is the frontend for the blogging platform built using **ReactJS** and **CKEditor**. It communicates with the backend REST API to display, create, and manage blog posts.

##  Approach

1. **UI**: Built with ReactJS using modern components and state management.
2. **Editor**: Integrated CKEditor for rich text post creation and editing.
3. **Routing**: Used `react-router-dom` to handle multiple pages (Home, Dashboard, Edit Post, etc.).
4. **Auth Handling**: JWT tokens are stored in `localStorage`, and protected routes are implemented.
